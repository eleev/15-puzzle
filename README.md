# üïπ Controls
- **Swipe** anywhere to move the cells
- **Tap** ‚Ü∂ button to shuffle the cells
- When you solve the puzzle, you will see the corresponding overlay dialog
- When time exceeds (01:00:00 / 1 hour) or the number of moves will reach it's maximum (10.000) the game will be over

# üëª Features
- [x] Supports both `iPhone` & `iPad`
- [x] Moves counter
- [x] Timer
- [x] Solution validator
- [x] Rendering backend implemented on top of `SpriteKit`
- [x] Shuffling
- [x] Haptic Feedback for supported devices
- [x] Minimal supported `iOS` deployment target is `11.0`

# ‚è± Futher Improvements / Current Limitations
- [ ] Only **portrait** mode 
- [ ] Game **timer** works even when the app is in background (for a while). Ideally it needs to be paused/resumed when entering/resuming the app
- [ ] Missing **unit tests** coverage, despite the possibility to test most of the code
- [ ] Ideally, the in-game state needs to be modelled by **state machines** (`playing`, `shuffling`, `game over` and `puzzle solved` states, and when **solver** is implemented a new state for `solving` needs to be modelled as well)
- [ ] Missing **solver**: can be implemented by using `A*` or `BFS` algorithms. Since it's an `NP-complete` algorithm, it needs to be carefully designed and tested (performance implications)
- [ ] Add **macOS** target
